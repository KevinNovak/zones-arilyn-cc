	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>
		Arilyn Bots a small team of developers dedicated to creating fun and useful Discord bots, and
		other apps.
	</p>
	<p>
		zones.arilyn.cc is just one of our side-projects, designed to be a companion app to <a
			href="https://friend-time.arilyn.cc/"
			target="_blank">Friend Time</a
		>, a Discord bot to easily convert times mentioned in chat to others time zones. Friend Time
		started as a small project to help our international friend group keep track of our gaming
		sessions and has since grown into a full-fledged bot with many features. If you use Discord, and
		need to coordinate across multiple time zones, we highly recommend checking it out!
